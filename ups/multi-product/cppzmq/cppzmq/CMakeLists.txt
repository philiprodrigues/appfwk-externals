# We could just set the CMAKE_INSTALL_*DIR directories directly to
# ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${ers_*_dir}, but we want to
# use CPack, which only knows about files/directories that are
# install()ed. So we install into a staging area and then install()
# from the staging area into the final destination
